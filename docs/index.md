# Documentation Introduction

## Proper Music B2B Store

### What's Covered

This Document was created as a User Guide for B2B, although it does document some of the more technical aspects of the site, as well as an overview of the Admin side of B2B.

The documentation covers all Store Side features like the Order Import, BackOrder management, Advanced Product Search that are available for all Users. We will also look at navigating
through the administration side of B2B and what features and options may be useful, while also pointing out settings that should not be changed.

There will be some technical references to the codebase for B2B, which is more of a developer guide and will be covered completely in the **[Source Code](/docs/category/the-source-code)** notes.

It is intended as a base from which Change Management work items can be created and as a reference point for Proper Music support staff.
