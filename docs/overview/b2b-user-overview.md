The B2B Solution

B2B is an integral application of the ProperMusic workflow and one application of three that most users interact with (ProperMusic.Web, OneSheets and B2B). It controls the configuration, sales, and handling of Products created through ProperWeb.

The application uses the open-source eCommerce software NopCommerce and is customised through multiple custom plugins.

Access to frequently used options is available from the toolbar, for example, the Customer list and Scheduling screens.
While this is functionally adequate, the UI is extremely dated and is not representative of how modern applications created by the Clarion Development language can look.
