How to Import your Orders

The Order Import system allows you to add products to your order in large quantities from a CSV or an Excel sheet. The only basic details we need for each product is the Catalogue Number or the Barcode and the quantity you want to import.

You can also easily get the valid format and names of each column that we need to correctly import your products by downloading the template from the Download dropdown button.

If we then download these results from the dropdown, it will have the relevant comments for each order line

Note: you can re-import this "Downloaded Results" file without changing your column headers as we match which column is which by the column name

Any errors in your import will appear if you hover over the red exclamation point next to the Download dropdown, and the valid products will be imported.

The two checkboxes are options that will effect your import:
- Replace Order will empty your order before you import more products
- Back Order Pre-Release will add any products that aren&apos;t released yet onto your stores back order (Also skipping the automatic check for pre-releases on import)

You can also find a detailed guide of this process in Download dropdown by clicking "Download Guide"
