The Main Plugin

The application uses a traditional Ring Type menu along with a Quick Access toolbar.

Access to frequently used options is available from the toolbar, for example, the Customer list and Scheduling screens.
While this is functionally adequate, the UI is extremely dated and is not representative of how modern applications created by the Clarion Development language can look.

An alternate, modern UI could use both a contracted left Nav Bar or expanded menu structure: -
Contracted Nav Bar
Expanded Menu

List Screens
An example of typical “List” type screen is the Customer list.


As stated for the menu navigation, most of the application’s function screens use a dated UI along with basic toolset features.  Most “List” type screens include a “Data Filter Center” allowing the user to perform and save queries.

Using modern tools here instead of the original built in toolset options would not only enhance the UI, but would also add more functionality.  For example, optional data grouping, inline filtering and user customisable content.  The screen space used for the “Data Filter Center” could then be reused for additional list space or related record information.
